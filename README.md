This page contains the course project #3, developed at the University of Guilan for Deep Learning course in Spring 2022 semester.

## ðŸ”¨ Project Title
Introduction to CNNs, convolutions, max pooling, mean (avg.) pooling, track changes in the training procedure, detect overfitting, adding dropout and batch normalization in order to prevent overftting, implement more advanced architectures like ResNet, Inception Networks, using transfer learning.
